POSCUP stands for Poster On-demand for Speakers, Users, and Promoters.
Its name is inspired by [COSCUP](http://coscup.org), where famous **Lightning Talk**s are held at end of each day. POSCUP aimed to provide an easy-to-use keynote application which enables end user to generate large-print posters on demand during their sessions. If you like this project, please help contribute to it, or fork it as you like.

Some quick facts about this project:
*	POSCUP is written by C# / WPF. 
	We're looking forward for a Qt port since the familiar infrastructure.

*	POSCUP is licensed under MIT.
	[OpenFoundry](http://www.openfoundry.org/licenses/34 "MIT License (MIT)") makes a clear explanation of what MIT does.

*	POSCUP is free for anyone.
	Though originally targeted lightning talk speakers, we hope you can make good use of it to promote your ideas. Tell us if you're the crazy ones who eventually changed the world by POSCUP!
